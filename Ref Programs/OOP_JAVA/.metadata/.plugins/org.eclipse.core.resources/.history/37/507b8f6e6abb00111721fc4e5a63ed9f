Inheritance:
------------


Method Overriding
--------------------

 --> re-implementing super class's behav logic in different way
     in sub-class.
 
 
 Rules:
 -------
 
    1. Must be same
    
        --> Method Name
        --> Type of args
        --> Number of arg
        --> Order of args
        
         --> Return Type
        
    2. May different
        
        --> Access specifier ( should not reduce visibility )
        
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  Polymorphism 
  -------------
  
  
  One Object/Type doing same behav in different way based
  input or Envi.	
  
  Types:
  ------
  
  1. static/compile : overloading
  
  2. dynamic/runtime : overriding ( Inheritance )
  
  
  
 
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 Implicit Reference Type Casting
 ----------------------------------
 
 
  Assigning sub-class objs to super class
  reference var.
  
  why we need?
  
  To view all different sub class objs as one type,
  to do same behav in different way ( Runtime poly ) using
  that one type.
  
  
 Explicit Reference Type Casting
 ----------------------------------
 
 why we need?
 
  To get specific functionality from sub-class obj, when it
  is assigned to common type.
  
  Imp Note: If 'instanceOf' returns true.
