Abstract Class
-----------------


  More generalized class, no intention to create
  instance.
  
  use: To maintain common state $ behav for sub-classes.
  
   
   Abstract Methods:
   -----------------
   
   Method without body
   
   when to use: To force sub-classes to Override that
                behav.
                
   
    Imp Notes :
    -----------
    
    
    --> For A.C we can create instance but we can create reference
        var.
        
    --> If any class having atleast one abstract method, then class
        must be a abstract class.
        
    --> If any sub-class that extends abstract class with abstract
        methods, must override those.   
        
    --> If every sub-class going override super-behav,define that
        behav as 'abstract method'
