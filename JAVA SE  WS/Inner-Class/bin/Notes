Nested/Inner Classes
----------------------


  why we need?
  -----------
  
  
      --> To group all strong associated class within Main
          class.
          
      --> To Encapsulate the class.
      
      --> To Overcome Multiple-Inheritance Limitation on class.
      
      --> To Access private members of One class in other
          class.
      
      
 Types of nested Class:
 ---------------------
 
   1. Non-Static inner Class.
   2. Static inner Class
   3. Local inner Class ( Much Used )
   4. Anonymous inner Class ( Most Used )
 
          
          
          Imp Notes --> Anonymous Inner Class
          ------------------------------------
          
          When to use:
          
          Need only one one-sub class object having overrided method
          within a method.
          
          rules:
          -----
          
          --> A.I.C always mmust be extended/implemented by.
          --> For A.I.C first create Object, then define
              Class.
          --> A.I.C obj will be assigned to super-class/
              interface reference var.
          --> A.I.C must have Overrided methods, otherwise defining
              A.I.C is waste.
          --> For A.I.C, we can Object only once.
          --> Scope of A.I.C is within Method.
